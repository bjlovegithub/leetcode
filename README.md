# What is for?

Code repository for leetcode and other programming skill like codes, such as google code jam.

# Optimization

Codes are initially submitted during the contest, and they have not been fully optimized. I will try to
improve code efficiency(memory usage and time complexity) further.

# Not statifisied?

Thanks for interesting in this repository. Any PR is appreciated.
